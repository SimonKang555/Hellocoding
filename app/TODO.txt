Homework:
1.

1. Ranking:
- Only show Top 15 rankings:
- Use Dialog to show Rankings
- In Ranking, we show "Actual ranking", "UserName", "Time taken to win the game"
- We need to ask user to create username before the game begins.

Tasks
- Simon:
1. Currently, when warriror arrives at opponent's base, the animation gets shrink. Try to see if you can make animation not shrink (Or make it look as close to walking animation size)
2. Make the username textview more explicit to see. (Maybe relocate? Maybe setting background color to gray like other views?)
